## Group Project 2

An app designed to collect and store useful information about video games: in essence, a custom compiled game guide.

## Why?

I have a second laptop computer that's getting on in years and is nothing more than a glorified word processor at this point. It's useful for spreadsheeting, but not for internet surfing. When I want to look up game information I have to close my game and surf on my gaming computer. _(I wish everyone had these kinds of problems.)_

This app will eventually allow me to surf to useful game links on my phone. No backing out of the game if I don't want to.

### What do I mean by useful game links?

* That thing I read about when I first got the game and can't quite remember where I read it. You know the feeling if you're a gamer.
* That other thing someone finally mentioned near the end of a fanboy flame war about which console is superior. You know the feeling if you're a mature gamer.

I'm happy with the final product and although it still has a quirky bug I'm going to finish it off and use it.
